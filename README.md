Project Description: 
In this project , we collect images from different web link. After getting images, we made a .npz file and save into a same folder.
Also we make all the function related to code on this same folder.We made label according to the images.
We made some different function to execute this Project.

We got around 95% accuracy in this Project.
All the data set and pre-trained model given through a Drive Link.
